by Bryan "Zouave" Dillow

Objective: Take the enemy flag from YOUR
base to the ENEMY base.  

Scoring: 
1 points for taking the flag to the enemy
courtyard.
4 points for getting the flag inside the 
enemy base.
10 points for capturing the flag

Flag carriers drop the Flag when
they die. Dropped flags return to their Base
after 60 seconds or if touched by the 
enemy.

of wall at each base are detpackable.
