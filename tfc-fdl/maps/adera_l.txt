adera_l - Capture The Flag

Objective: Capture the enemy flag by deactivating their security laser and doors. By deactivating the enemy's security doors you will have a much easier and faster way to access the flag room. The security downtime is only 45 seconds, so be fast and good luck!

Scoring: 10 points per Capture.

Other Notes: Flag carriers drop the Flag when
they die. Dropped flags return to their Base
after 30 seconds.
