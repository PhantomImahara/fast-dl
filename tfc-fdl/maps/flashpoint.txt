Goals:
  Secure all 5 command points
  Activate fusion reactor (with power relays)
  
Gameplay:
  If both objectives are met the
  reactor complex is CAPTURED.
  
  Capturing team obtains additional
  spawn locations and must protect the
  power stations from detpack attacks.
  
  Missing relays can be repaired at any
  time.  If all are destroyed, you have
  15 seconds to restore one before the 
  reactor hits the point of no return and 
  explodes. (This resets the map)
