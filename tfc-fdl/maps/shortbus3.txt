The Shortbus 3:
Frag Race 2002
by poopfoot

Drive the shortbus through four checkpoints to score!
You must be in the front of the 'bus - not the roof,
not in the back - to successfully pass a checkpoint.
Checkpoints can be passed in any order.  You need 
not be in direct control of the 'bus in order to 
pass a checkpoint.

Each checkpoint passed gains 2 frags for the
player who activates each checkpoint first.

Passing all four checkpoints gives 10 points
to your team!

Once all checkpoints are passed by a team, there is
a 15 second reset delay for that team's checkpoints.

As always, try not to get run over by the shortbus.
