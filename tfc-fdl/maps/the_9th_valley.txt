The 9th Valley - Capture The Flag
    -- the_9th_valley.bsp --

Objective:
Enter the enemy Base and make your way round
to the warp tunnel. Access to this is CRUICIAL
as it leads to where their Flag resides.

Grab it and bring it back to your MAIN DOOR.
Place it on the square with your team logo
to Capture it. 

Scoring: 10 points per Capture.

Other Notes:
Flag carriers drop the Flag when they die.
Dropped flags return to their Base after
60 seconds or if they are dropped in an
irretrievable place (EXCEPT WARP TUNNEL)

The lava pit in the mine is NOT a dead end.

Thx goes to [WTF?]Moog for the Fullmoon sky.
