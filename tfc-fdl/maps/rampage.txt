OBJECTIVES:
The Red and Blue teams must take their flag 
from the center arena and bring it to the 
capture point deep in the enemy base. 
The Yellow team does everything in their power 
to stop either team from capturing the flag. 
---------------
SCORING:
Red and Blue get 10 points and 5 frags per cap. 
Yellow in turn gets 4 points every 5 minutes.

NOTES:
The flags are guarded by a laser, which may be turned 
off by a switch accross the arena.
Flags remain where dropped for 45 seconds, and flag 
runners move at a slightly reduced speed.
