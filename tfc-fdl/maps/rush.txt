Rush - Invade and defend
by Alexander Taylor aka Tayl0r

Objective: Each team must take the flag in
their base to the capture point outside the
other teams.

Scoring: 10 points per Capture.

Other Notes: Flag carriers drop the Flag when
they die. Dropped flags return to their Base
after 60 seconds.
