****Special Thanks to DKStrike for his ideas, inspiration, playtesting
and for his refusing to let me give up countless times on this map.
More thanks to Ev1L4FuN for helping with the playtesting and for
finding those remote dark corners I would have never guessed a player
could reach.  Finally, thanks to everyone else I haven't mentioned.
All your support has meant the world to me.****
