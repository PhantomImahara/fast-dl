Objective: Enter the enemy Base and make
your way to where their Flag resides.
Grab it and bring it back to your
Base. Place it on the capture point to
Score 10 points for your team. 

Scoring: 10 points per Capture.

Other Notes: Flag carriers drop the Flag when
they die. Dropped flags return to their Base
after 60 seconds.
Other Other Notes: Balcony lasers stay down for
20 seconds (with 10 extra seconds before the 
button becomes active again, Blast Doors for 60
with a 10 second inactive period on the button).
