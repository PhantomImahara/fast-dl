Objective: enter the enemy base, deactivate the laser security system,
and make your way to where their flag resides. Grab the flag, bring it
back to your base, and place it on the raised square to score 10 points.
Stop the enemy team from capturing your flag.

Scoring: 10 points per capture.

Warning: if you attempt to enter either of your respawn areas whilst you
are carrying the enemy flag, it will be removed & returned to its
original position behind the enemy laser security.
