------IRON MAN------
King-of-the-Hill

OBJECTIVE: Go to the enemy's base,
take your colored flag, and go 
through the underground, to the
generator room, and up the ladder
to the top of the tower where the
cap point is. 

SCORING: 2 points every 10 seconds
you contol the point. I think.

Notes: This is my first map--
enjoy!
