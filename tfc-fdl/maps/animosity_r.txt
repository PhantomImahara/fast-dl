Description: Similar 2fort type layout
with 2 forts facing each other with
a bridge betwen and water. It's a
little diff. in that it's at night
instead of day as most maps are and
after going through base, you exit
back outside to an outdoors flagroom.
Also water entrance leading to the
uper level of the ramp room once
the water entrance door has been blown
by detpack.
