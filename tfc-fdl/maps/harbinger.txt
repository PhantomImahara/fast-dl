Harbinger - CaHTF (Capture and Hold The Flag)
By: AKULA-J- (akula@planetfortress.com)

Objective: Enter the enemy base and make
your way to where their flag resides in the
lower flag room. Grab it and bring it 
back to your cap point in the upper flag room.
Then defend it for long as possible while at
the same time keeping control of your own flag.

Scoring:  2 Pts for each flag capture
              1 Pt for returning a captured flag
              2 Pts every 20 seconds the enemy flag is CAPed
              1 Pt every 20 seconds your flag is at home.

Other Notes: Dropped flags return to their base after
60 seconds. Captured flags can be returned to base by
touching them. Freshly captured/returned flags cannot
be returned/stolen for 5 seconds. Signs in each base light
up to indicate what flags that team has control over.
Useing flaginfo and these lighted signs will show exactly
where to go to steal/return the two flags.

IF you're totaly lost ATM just play it like a stock CTF map and 
keep your eyes and ears open, you'll figure out the rest quickly.
