VIDAR'S NIFLHEIM 2 - Capture The Flag
By: Neil Manke

Vidar - Norse God of Vengence
Niflheim - Region of Ice and Cold

Objective: Enter the enemy Fortress and make 
your way to where their Flag resides in the 
Tower. Grab it and bring it back to the base 
of your Tower. Place it on the raised square 
to Capture it. The flag will then return to 
the enemy Base.

Scoring: 10 points per Capture.

Notes: 
-Flag carriers drop the Flag when they die. 
Dropped Flags return to their Base after 65 
seconds.
-The ice tunnel under the glacier requires a 
detpack to clear. Another detpack explosion 
can re-seal it.
