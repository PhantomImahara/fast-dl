Villa - True Territorial Control

Objective: Bring your team's flag to one
of the five command points and defend the
command point.

Scoring: One point for every thirty seconds
your team holds a command point.

Other Notes: Flag carriers walk at half-speed. 
There IS NO bonus for securing all five command 
points and the command points ARE NOT reset upon 
a team securing all five command points. Team 
control centers cannot be destroyed.
