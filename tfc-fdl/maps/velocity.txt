Velocity - Capture The Flag

Objective: Enter the enemy Base and make
your way to where their Flag resides in the
Rear of the base. Grab it and bring it back to your
Main Room. Place it on the raised square to
Capture it. 

Scoring: 10 points per Capture.

Other Notes: Flag carriers drop the Flag when
they die. Dropped flags return to their Base
after 60 seconds.

The enemy grate can be detpacked for easy access 
to the main room.

If The flag happens to fall into the pit, the 
flag will attempt to return to the place it was 
thrown from, or the last place the player was thats 
safe.  It it fails at its attempts after 3 times, 
the flag  will return.  So, if the flag
falls into the pit, you will be able to find it
back at then enemy flag room, or around the pit.
