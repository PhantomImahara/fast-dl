Dam - Capture The Flag

Objective: Enter the enemy base and make
your way to where their flag resides in the
flooded basement. Grab it and bring it back to
your ramp room. Place it on the raised square
to capture it. 

Scoring: 10 team points per capture, and 10
frags for the carrier who captured it.

Other Notes: Flag carriers drop the flag when
they die. Dropped flags return to their base
after 60 seconds.
