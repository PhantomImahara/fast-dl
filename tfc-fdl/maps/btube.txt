The Blood Tube - Capture The Flag

Objective: Enter the enemy Base and make
your way to the back of the lower level 
where their flag resides. Grab it and bring 
it back to the capture point on your roof. 

Place it on the raised square to capture it. 

Scoring: 10 points per Capture. 10 frags to
the player who captures it.

they die. Dropped flags return to their Base
after 60 seconds.
