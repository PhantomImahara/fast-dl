Ravelin CTF - Capture the Flag
(A standard Capture the Flag conversion of Ravelin by
Dimmi64.)

Objective: Enter the enemy base and make
your way to where their flag resides. 
Grab it and bring it back to your
base. Place it on the raised square to
capture it. 

Scoring: 10 points for each capture.

Other Notes: Use a detpack to destroy 
the enemy's power generator. This will
disable spot lights and laser security
grid guarding alternate entrance to the
command center. Engineer can repair the
power generator after it has been broken.
