NOUGAT! - Capture The Flag
by Jeff Winkworth (JKWSN_superdude)

Objective: Use the walkways to make your way 
to where their Flag resides. Grab it and 
bring it back to the ledge above your spawn 
area.


Scoring: 10 points per Capture.


Other Notes: 

Flag carriers drop the Flag when they die.

Dropped flags return to their Base
after 60 seconds.

Don't hit the ground. You will die.
