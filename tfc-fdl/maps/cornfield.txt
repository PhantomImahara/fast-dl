Invade and defend

Objective: Blue team starts as the attacker.
Red team starts as the defender. The attacking
team starts at the glider wreckage and must
take control of the town by pushing through and
taking control of four Command Points sequentially.
The defending team simply tries to hold out as
long as they can. Once the attackers succeed,
teams swap, and play begins again.

Command Points are captured by taking the flag
from the previous point and carrying it to the
next. When a Command Point is secured, the flag
required to capture the next Command Point 
appears on top of it. For example, the flag 
needed to capture Command Point 3 will always 
spawn at Command Point 2. Dropped flags return
after 15 seconds.

Scoring:
Attacking team - 10 points per Command Point
captured.
Defending team - Points are awarded over time
for defending the Bridge (Command point 4).
