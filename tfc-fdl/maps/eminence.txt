Eminence.
CTF map by Gogeta.
Info:
-I'm pretty sure this map can be played anything from 1v1-9v9.
 2v2s etc. could just say no security or such.
-The detwall is to encourage Heavy D, and to keep the D away from the front door.
-Bag in the flagroom takes 15 seconds to respawn.
-Each Grenade bag gives 1 grenade each.
-Lasers go down for 30 seconds.
-There is a secret cap.
