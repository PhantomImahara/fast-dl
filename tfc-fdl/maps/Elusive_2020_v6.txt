Objective: Make your way to the back of the enemy base
and steal the flag. Toss the flag down the lasers or 
run the flag out the way you came in. Capture the enemy
flag in the corner at the entrance of your base.

Scoring: 10 points per Capture.

Security: Enemy Team lasers will always kill you and
can't be turned off.

Notes: Flag carriers drop the Flag when
they die. Dropped flags return to their Base
after 60 seconds.
