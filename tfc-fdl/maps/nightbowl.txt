NightBowl is a spin off on the highly popular
"DustBowl" map, but takes place at night, which
provides an awesome environment to sneak around
and lots of dark places to hide. Have Fun !!

Red team's Headquarters to win the game. 
There are two command points on the way 
which must be secured in order.
