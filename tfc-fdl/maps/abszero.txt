Objective: Make your way to the enemy Canyon where your 
Flag is being held. Pick it up and take it to the
Center Bridge to capture it. It will stay there until 
the enemy team gets their Flag from your Canyon and 
captures it at the same Capture Point.

Scoring: 5 Team Points, 5 Frags, and 30 seconds of Quad 
Damage for taking the Capture Point.
5 Team Points every 30 seconds thereafter that your 
team holds the Capture Point.

Notes: Dropped flags return after 60 seconds. All 
packs are useable by either team.
