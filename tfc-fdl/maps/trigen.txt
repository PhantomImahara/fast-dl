Trigen - Capture The Flag
By Ziggo

Objective: Enter the enemy base and make
your way to where their flag resides. Grab it and bring it
back to your battlements. Place it on the raised square
to capture it. 

Scoring: 10 points per capture.

Other Notes: Flag carriers drop the flag when
they die. Dropped flags return to their base
after 60 seconds.
