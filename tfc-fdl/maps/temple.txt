Temple - Capture The Flag

Objective: Enter the enemy temple and make
your way to where their Flag resides in the
church. Get it and bring it back to your
Healing Pool. Place it in the Pool to
Capture it. 

Scoring: 5 points per Capture.
	 10 points per secondary cappage
	 5 points for flooding the holy chamber with lava

Other Notes: Flag carriers drop the Flag when
they die. Dropped flags return to their temple
after 60 seconds.  If the flag is in lava, it could
return quicker.

The Primary Capture Point is on the lower level, 
in the healing pool well.  It is directly under the
flag room.

To Activate Secondary Cap Point:  As DEMOMAN set a
detpack in front of the enemy HAND that is guarding
the holy chamber.  With the Hand destroyed, you can
have access.  Get on top of the button with the scarab.
Eventually, you will destroy the holy chamber.  
The Destruction grants your team 5 points and the ability
to cap for twice the amount of points.  The Secondary Cap Point
is in the church flag room.

There is a button in the ramp room area that will cause a grate
to appear over the lava pit under the church.  You can use
this grate to escape with the flag, and other uses.
