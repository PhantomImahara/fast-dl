Scoring: 10 points per flag capture
	 15 points for computer detonation

Map Description:
You already know the drill. Make your way to
the enemy flagroom and bring the flag down
from the platform and back to your base.

Capture points are in the "main" rooms
across from the "bottom" respawn.

The computers are a once-a-round way
to gain an extra 15 points for your team.
Getting a demoman up to the pc to detpack
might not prove to be an easy task. Enjoy.
