Map notes:	The penguin models and candycane models were previously
		used in another map of mine called mario_xmas
	
		To see the all of the models, it is recommended to have 				mp_allowmonsters 1 activated while playing this level

		To do so, pull down console with the ~ tilde key, type 				mp_allowmonsters 1, press enter, then type changelevel
		penguin_park and press enter.
