---Notes---
This map is based on a map from Unreal Tournament (which is
one of my favorites). I wanted to do something different and fun. 
Basically, you're out in the middle of space, on a destroyer ship that 
has fighter jets protecting it. Inside the Phantom gravity is normal. 
Once you step out, theres less gravity. The stronger weapons are either 
harder to get or in a place where you'll have to use another weapon to 
get to them. There are no secrets. It takes strategy and wisdom to 
be able to completely dominate on this map.           

E-mail me with any comments on the level, praise or criticism.
Any feedback is much appreciated. My next map is soon to be released.

---Special thanks---
First of all, I want to thank my brother Ivan aka EYEVEN and my 
friends Marq aka NIMROD and VENGEANCE for helping me. My brother 
re-aligned all of my textures and did an outstanding job and Marq took 
the time to play test my map. I would like to give a great deal of 
gratitude to VENGEANCE "http://vhoh.tripod.com/" for taking the time 
to help me out with all of my questions and problems. I also want to 
thank UT for the beautiful textures and Vlas for the excellent sky map. 
I want to thank my wife for her support and encouragement. And most of 
all, I want to thank Sierra for producing such an awesome game, HL.

---Installation---
Place the:

.bsp in your \maps folder

.wad in your \valve folder

sky map (everything else that has the name "stars_") in your \valve\gfx\env folder.

Note that I am still a rookie. Therefore, I do not know how to use hlcc and 
its settings to include the .wad file and the sky map in a .res file to make 
it an easier installation. If any one knows how, can you give me an email? 
All help is greatly appreciated.
