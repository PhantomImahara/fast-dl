Description             : Halflife DM level for 8-12 players. This
                          is a convertion of my forvorite Unreal
                          DM Level.  Generally alot of frags due to
                          the openness but lots of fun. May lag on
                          slower systems due to this openness
Special Thanks to       : Valve for creating Halflife, Epic for
                          creating Unreal and ID for starting it all.

Installation

To play this level, extract the file "deck16.bsp" into
your sierra\half-life\valve\maps directory and then start the game.
Start a deathmatch server and type "map deck16" or "changelevel
deck16" in the console. To test it out in single player mode
start Halflife with hl.exe -console -toconsole -dev. This enables
you to try some stuff using the cheat codes (no Hazard Suit though)
