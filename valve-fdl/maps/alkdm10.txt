Map Description         : A unique colourful industrial structure using textures from Sin. Mixtures of charcoal coloured steel, tanned and wooden panels with metal trim, broken up by pale layers of concrete under a bright white moon. It's quite an open fast map that supports about 5 players best.

Other Info		: 
For more fun on this map, try the Quake3 Capture the Flag version. It works great with 4-8 players and looks even better.
