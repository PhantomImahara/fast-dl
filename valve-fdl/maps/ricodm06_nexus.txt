.::  Map Description  ::.

The map is based on an original concept I once designed on paper. It consists of a large, open arena area surrounded by ledges. 
The design is actually symmetrical, and each of the passages mirror each other. Their are four large rooms at the four sides of the arena, each with it's
own specific weapon. It is pretty large, and I am suprised I could get this to you, enjoy ;)
