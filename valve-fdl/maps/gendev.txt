Extra Information:
--------------------
This is my first released DM map.
To use the air jump correctly, do not press
	jump. Simply run through the lift area.
This map is intended for a 1 on 1 battle or a 3
	player FFA. 4 players is about the max
	you could feasibly fit in the arena.
The air jump also affects projectiles. This
	includes: rockets, grenades, AR grenades,
	trip mines, satchels, and hive hands.
Do to the small area, the map is designed to give
	players either an mp5 or shotgun quickly.
	The more advanced weapons(hivehand, crossbow,
	rpg) require a more advanced manuver to gain.
The advanced weapons are powerful, but not 100%
	usefull in this map. The RPG isn't good for
	the close quarters. The hive hand gets pushed
	by the air jump, and the crossbow requires
	quick reflexes. These weaknesses may work
	against you, so look out.
Remember to vary your weapon use. If players use the
	same weapons repeatedly, a new weapon will
	throw them off balance and force them to find
	a new start.

Personal Information
--------------------
I am currently a Freshman at the University of Kansas.
If you are interested on contacting me, my e-mail is above.
I do not use ICQ as it becomes a hassle to authorize people,
so don't ask for my number. I use e-mail and e-mail alone.
I am not interested in teaching you how to map. I learned on my
own and so can you. Only send me technical questions about my
map not working on your system. If you are the author of a mod
and interested in having me work on it, please e-mail me with the
mods web address. I only work for mod teams that have something
original and actually have some sort of code done. No CS ripoffs.
No "I thought of this idea yesterday" mods. Sorry, thems the beaks.
Please check my site often for updates on my future projects. Thank
you for downloading my map. Please help support the mapping community
in the future, as well. Thanks again. Enjoy Genesis Prime.
