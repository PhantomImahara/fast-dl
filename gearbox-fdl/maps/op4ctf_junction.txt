Transit Junction
By Morlam (morlamweb@yahoo.com)

The battle for control of Black Mesa 
took to the subways as the civilians 
advanced on the Central Transit Junction.  
With control of the Junction, the 
armed refugees commanded a sizable advantage 
over the soldiers.  The military could 
not allow this to happen, and in retaliation 
set up a headquarters not far from the 
civilian camp.  A confrontation loomed as 
military recon squads unknowingly sped into 
a head on collision with a Black Mesa 
strike force...
